# Molmer-Sorensen gate simulation using QuTIP

Announcement: This project was done as part of the project with Prof. Junki Kim at Quantum Engineering with Trapped Ions (QuETI) on building an
trapped-ion hamiltonian simulator for simpified spin-boson system. The final code will either be published at QuETI github page or this page by end of July.

## Abstract

Developed a simulator for Molmer-Sorensen Gate using QuTIP. This simulator gives the systemâ€™s state as density matrix at given time and shows that this process has no dependenceon the vibrational quantum number of the qubit state.
